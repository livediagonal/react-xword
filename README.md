# React Crossword Solver

A React component for solving crossword puzzles, supporting the iPuz format.

## Features

- Interactive crossword grid with keyboard and mouse support
- Mobile-friendly with virtual keyboard
- Smart navigation that automatically moves to the next empty cell
- Support for checking answers and revealing solutions
- Timer functionality
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Support for iPuz format puzzles

## Navigation Behavior

The crossword solver features intelligent navigation that helps you move through the puzzle efficiently:

1. **Filling Empty Cells**:
   - When you fill in the last empty cell of an answer, the cursor automatically advances to the next clue
   - If you fill in a cell but there are still other empty cells in the answer, the cursor moves to the next cell in the current answer

2. **Replacing Letters**:
   - When you replace a letter in the middle of an answer, you stay in the current answer
   - If you replace a letter in the last cell and the answer becomes complete, the cursor advances to the next clue

3. **End of Answer Behavior**:
   - If you reach the end of an incomplete answer, the cursor cycles back to the first empty cell in that answer
   - If you reach the end of a complete answer, the cursor advances to the next clue

4. **Orientation Changes**:
   - When you complete the last answer in one orientation (across/down), the cursor automatically switches to the other orientation
   - The cursor always moves to the first empty cell of the next answer

This navigation system ensures a smooth solving experience by automatically guiding you to the next cell that needs attention.

  width: number;
  height: number;
}

interface IPuzCell {
  cell?: number;
  style?: {
    shapebg?: string;
  };
  value?: string;
}

type IPuzGrid = (IPuzCell | string | null)[][];

interface IPuzClue {
  number: number;
  clue: string;
  answer?: string;
  format?: string;
}

interface IPuzClues {
  Across: IPuzClue[];
  Down: IPuzClue[];
}

interface IPuzMetadata {
  title?: string;
  author?: string;
  editor?: string;
  copyright?: string;
  publisher?: string;
  date?: string;
  notes?: string;
}

interface IPuzPuzzle {

  puzzle: IPuzGrid;
  clues: IPuzClues;
  solution?: string[][];
  metadata?: IPuzMetadata;
}
```
